# Welcome to the SWTPC Page
This page covers the details of my SWTPC 6800 Computer. As the name suggested this is based on a Motorola 6800 8bit CPU. While the other useful links has more information about the SWTPC the most comprehensive site is by Michael Holley and can be found at [SWTPC.com](http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/)

## My Machine

WIP: This section will contain all the hardware specs of my 6800

## My Documentation

This section has a link to my documentation page. These are all the hardcopy documents and notes I received with the system when I got it. This is a pretty comprehensive collection of documents for its time, and before the advent of the web would have be critical as these machines are not always intuitive to use.
